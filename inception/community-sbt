# Spec for a future "Community SBT" widget
This community-driven spec is a collaborative community-led effort to create a functional specification for a widget to be developed. The goal is to bring clarity and alignment to the deliverables for developers to deliver a functional widget that meets the requirements.

# Overview
<!-- Describe the widget in one sentence. -->
This widget will allow users to apply for a Community SBT as a part of [i-am-human](https://i-am-human.app/), whereby users are awarded this SBT if they are verified as "human" by other applicants. How will this work? A user first stakes Near to be able to apply. They are then directed to come back at a given date and time, at which point many applicants will log on simultaneously. The widget will pair up applicants randomly and bring them into paired video chats where they introduce themselves to each other and then classify the other as either "not suspicious" or "suspicious". After three successful video chats the applicant is accepted and half of their stake is returned. Some of the chats (one of three?) will be with trusted community members, who are incentivized to help out by offering them the other half of the applicant's stake. Some of the chats will be with "actors" who are told to act suspiciously, and if a user classifies them as suspicious then they lose their stake.
