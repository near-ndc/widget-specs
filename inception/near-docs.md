# Spec for a future "NEAR Docs" widget
This community-driven spec is a collaborative community-led effort to create a functional specification for a widget to be developed. The goal is to bring clarity and alignment to the deliverables for developers to deliver a functional widget that meets the requirements.

# Overview
<!-- Describe the widget in one sentence. -->
This widget should work similar to a wiki which will allow users to create and edit publically accessible documents, with some added features such as in-line commenting, ability to curate lists of wiki pages, ability to set different access rights for different users, and github-like pull requests to merge different drafts into the document.

There are already a few prototypes available on near.social for this functionality, see [here](https://near.social/#/testwiki.near/widget/WikiOnSocialDB), [here](https://near.social/#/humanman.near/widget/wiki.near.org), and [here](https://near.social/#/root.near/widget/Wiki). This spec builds on those prototypes.

Alternative names for this widget:
- Near Docs
- Near Wiki
- NDC Docs
- NDC Wiki
