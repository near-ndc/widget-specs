# widget-specs
NDC and the Governance Working Group will be using this repository to create specs for new widgets through a collaborative approach. We are soliciting input to these specs from whole community. The intent is to get lots of up front and early input on projects that we then intend to issue an RFP for building.

The process to edit these specs are standard GitHub pull requests. 

Templates are provided as recommendation. If you have better suggestions on how to structure your spec then feel free to do so.

To start out, we have seeded the repo with five blank templates for the next five widgets we'd like to build. 
- An NDC Gateway to track and manage work in the three "houses" of NDC (Ozzy is currently building the product book for this)
- Community SBT, which can be described as v2 of the OG SBT within i-am-human
- NEAR Docs, which will be the next iteration of the prototypes already on near.social
- Track My Bounty, a widget to apply for bounties and track progress towards payout acrossÂ  all grassroots
- Port NDC Academy to near.social

Which other ones should we add and start drafting specs for? Feel free to create on, fork a template, or message @KazanderDad or @blaze0x1 to propose it.
